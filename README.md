## Note:

1. All the cleaning and feature engineering processes done on dataset are in master branch.
3. Get dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data
4. For deployment we have used Heroku with CI/CD process. Configuration can be found in backend directory.
5. Process.ipynb is our final jupyter notebook in which we have all processes at one place. This file can be found in backend folder.
6. All other files in main branch are individual files as all of us were working using our own logics.
7. All individual worked files can be found in separate branches which are given by group member name.
